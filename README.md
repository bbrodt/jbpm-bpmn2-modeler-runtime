jbpm-bpmn2-modeler-runtime
==========================

JBPM-specific extension plugin for BPMN2 Modeler at eclipse.org

This plugin extends the BPMN2 Modeler at http://eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler and customizes
the editor for the BPMN2 subset supported by the JBPM runtime.

Most of the code in this plugin was originally developed as a part of the BPMN2 Modeler
Eclipse project. It was moved to github because it requires several JBPM libraries that
are not (yet?) Eclipse approved.
